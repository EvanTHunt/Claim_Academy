Technology has the power to transform our world and enhance our lives in ways we have not yet imagined. Since I was young, I have always had an instinctual urge to build and solve problems. The world of computers is progressing and evolving more rapidly than any other industry and will continue to do so exponentially, by Mooreâ€™s Law. Furthermore, I would like to be a part of the programming communities that are moving human kind forward through open collaboration and exploration of radical ideas.
